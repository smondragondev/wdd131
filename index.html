            <p>
                Hi! My name is Sergio MondragÃ³n and I am a software developer based in PerÃº.
                During my career, I have accumulated 3 years of experience in software development
                and ETL processes working with data from different sources and quality.

                I am excited to learn more about web development and improve my English skills.

                Elder's Quorum President in my ward.

            <h2>My City</h2>
            <p>
                FerreÃ±afe is a city in the Lambayeque Region in northern PerÃº. It is the capital of the FerreÃ±afe Province. It is located 30 km east of the city of Chiclayo. The city was founded on December 13, 1550 by captain Alonso de Osorio. An early civilization lived in this area, The Sican culture, which was a pre-Inca culture that built pyramids and buried their family lineage in forms that attract scholars from different fields of study. Here we have unique gastronomy, and ingredients such as Loche and Lucuma.
